    // Functions are a block of code that we put together that is given a name and is called to do what it is written for. sometimes functions do not have names - just like a person sitting next to you, they can be alerted by a nudge. Lambda functions will be an e.g.

    function say_hello(){
        console.log("Start of the say hello function");
        document.getElementById("p2").innerHTML = "Hello!";
        console.log("End of the say hello function");

    // how to grab hold of html element in the browser - use document = allows access to the DOM.
